"If you are stronger than I, I will let you go; come, let us try"; and he led him away through a dark passage to a smith's forge.

So the youth drew out the axe, and let him loose. Then the old man, leading him back into the castle, showed him three chests full of gold in a cellar. "One share of this," said he, "belongs to the poor, another to the King, and a third to yourself."</p></div> </div>
