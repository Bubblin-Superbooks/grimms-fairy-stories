When they reached home Two-Eyes again ate nothing; and her sister told her mother she knew now why the haughty hussy would not eat their victuals. "When she is out in the meadow," said her sister, "she says:</p><p><em>"'Little kid, milk</em></p><p>Table, appear!'</p><p>"and, directly, a table comes up laid out with meat and wine, and everything of the best, much better than we have; and as soon as she has had enough she says:</p><p><em>"'Little kid, milk</em></p><p>Table, depart!'</p><p>"and all goes away directly, as I clearly saw. Certainly she did put to sleep two of my eyes, but the one in the middle of my forehead luckily kept awake!"</p></div> </div>
