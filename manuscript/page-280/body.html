One was called Snow-White, and the other Rose-Red; and they were as religious and loving, busy and untiring, as any two children ever were.</p><p>Snow-White was more gentle, and quieter than her sister, who liked better skipping about the fields, seeking flowers, and catching summer birds; while Snow-White stayed at home with her mother, either helping her in her work, or, when that was done, reading aloud.</p><p>The two children had the greatest affection the one for the other.
